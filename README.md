## Why Prism

Most Markdown editors can render Markdown. Prism focuses on how writing feels.

Prism is a desktop Markdown editor built with Tauri, React, TypeScript, and CodeMirror 6. It is designed for calm long-form writing, polished preview typography, Chinese and mixed-language documents, and export workflows that preserve the visual quality of the page.

It is currently best suited for:

- Long-form Chinese writing
- Technical notes and product documents
- README and documentation drafts
- Markdown documents with code, tables, diagrams, and formulas
- Exporting themed documents to HTML, PDF, Word, or PNG

## Highlights

| What you get | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Edit / Split / Preview modes | Switch between focused writing, live comparison, and clean reading. |
| Chinese-first typography | Comfortable spacing, centered preview, and themes tuned for mixed Chinese and technical content. |
| CodeMirror 6 editor core | Reliable editing, selection, search, replace, and keyboard-driven workflows. |
| Markdown power features | GFM, syntax highlighting, Mermaid, KaTeX, tables, task lists, blockquotes, and more. |
| Five content themes | MiaoYan, Inkstone, Slate, Mono, and Nocturne Dark, each with its own visual tokens. |
| Product-grade export | Export HTML, PDF, Word (`.docx`), and PNG with themed rendering and Prism-native save dialogs. |
| Desktop workspace | Sidebar, file tree, outline, context menu, status bar, and auto-save. |

## Features

### Editing

- CodeMirror 6 editor with Markdown-friendly behavior
- Document search, replacement, current-hit highlighting, and navigation
- Edit, split, and preview modes
- Auto-save and dirty-state tracking
- Floating formatting toolbar for common Markdown actions
- Sidebar file tree, outline, and context menu

### Preview

- GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Mermaid diagrams
- KaTeX inline and block math
- Tables, task lists, blockquotes, links, marks, and horizontal rules
- Centered long-form preview layout

### Themes

Prism themes are not just color filters. Each theme owns its own font, background, border, code, blockquote, table, search, and export-dialog treatment.

- **MiaoYan**: quiet Chinese writing, warm paper, refined spacing
- **Inkstone**: ink-and-paper editorial tone
- **Slate**: cool blue-gray technical writing
- **Mono**: black-and-white lab notebook feeling
- **Nocturne Dark**: calm dark theme for night writing

### Export

Prism currently supports:

- **HTML**: standalone themed document
- **PDF**: rendered from the preview result
- **Word `.docx`**: structured document export
- **PNG**: full-page visual export

The export flow uses Prism's own save and overwrite UI instead of native replacement prompts, so the product feels consistent across the writing and delivery flow.
